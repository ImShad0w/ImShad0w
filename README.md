# 👋 Hey, I'm Kirill Pashnin

I'm a web development student with a growing focus on **cybersecurity** and **red teaming**.  
I love understanding how things work from the inside — building them, breaking them, and pushing myself to develop real mastery.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On
- Developing a **SaaS product** from scratch.
- Improving my backend skills using **PHP**, **Docker**, and **MySQL**.
- Learning cybersecurity fundamentals with a red-team mindset.

- **Frontend:**  Vue, React, Typescript, Javascript   
- **Backend:** PHP, Node.js , MySQL, Laravel 
- **DevOps:** Docker, Docker-compose  
- **Workflow**: Linux, Neovim

## 🔥 Current Goals
- Become highly competent in both **web development** and **cybersecurity**  
- Create a **full-featured AI assistant** controlling automation, scheduling, home systems, and more     

## 🌱 About Me
- I like understanding things deeply and improving piece by piece.  
- I enjoy building systems, automating things, and optimizing workflows.
